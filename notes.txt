TODO:
-if 2 chars are the same name, this creates an edit anomoly. We need to create some sort of unique match, or match on all rows to soften the blow
-remove console logs from inventory funcs
WHERE WE LEFT OFF:
    -Need to try to remove some global vars so we can modulize things
-Change array param to characters_array
-refactor and remove class numbers
-right click menu for spell books, as well as ALL menu
-Remove parameter for 'create_connection()'
-Refactor Right click options funcs
-Add sorting for iventory
-add 'Missing Spells'
-use 'show_please_wait_window()' for camp parser as well
-ask kas for OOP advice
-Since eq_dir is global, can probably remove EQ_dir from function params
-Add lvl col
-Timestamps so i dont re parse
-open individual inventory is bugging out
-Maybe add individual char query
-Add query for individual char_list
-Filters for item searches
    -Advanced filtering

-open window and 'query_char_inventory(rightclickedname)'
-takes fetch from WHERE name = 'x' and appends to global inventory_array
-calls filltablewithinventoryarray(), which fills table with global array (probably could have just passed the array in)
-So what do we have at this point?
    -inventory_array = [charname items]

-need to create a master object for 'class_spells'
{'necro': (2d list), ...etc}

-need to create a 'spellbook object'
{'charname': (2d list), ...etc}

-char in 'spellbook object':
    -char_class = 'char_classes[char]' 
    -char= 2dlist
    -iterate through class_spells[char_class]
        -if spell not in spellbook[char_name]:
            -spell.insert(0, char_name)
            -missing_spells.append(spell)

-We can either change the tuples inside 'class_spells' to lists, or change the lists in 'character_spellsbooks' to tuples
-CLASS SPELLS = int
-CHARACTER SPELLS = string

-Should store missings spells in DB
-When missing spells window is opened, query is performed
-At the moment, we are doing queries for diff chars missing spells
-Also, for the pulldown list for missing spells, we should fetch all the 'charNames' and populate list with that
-Not all missing spells are being created like they sohuld be
