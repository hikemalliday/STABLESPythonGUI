BUGS:
    
    -Why are we passing tree into 'inventory_window()'?
    
    -Multiple windows can be open at a time because we are importing funcs and passing params
        -This will be fixed with classes
    -Could add error handling for spell book type stuff. If pure melee, continue, etc
    -if 2 chars are the same name, this creates an edit anomoly. We need to create some sort of unique match, or match on all rows to soften the blow
    -Remove console logs from inventory funcs

WHERE WE LEFT OFF:



TODO:
    -OOP overhaul
    -Ad ID checks for Piece of a Medallion
    -refactor and remove class numbers
    -right click menu for spell books, as well as ALL menu
    -Remove parameter for 'create_connection()'
    -Refactor Right click options funcs
    -Can we add null check for files when attempting to parse? Could improve latency

-ask kas for OOP advice

-Add lvl col
-Timestamps so i dont re parse
-open individual inventory is bugging out
-Maybe add individual char query
-Add query for individual char_list
-Filters for item searches
    -Advanced filtering

--BIG REFACTOR IDEAS:
    -inventory_window():
        -Add a checker at the beginning of window launch to see if selected char does not exist in DB, and abort on the spellbooks_object
            -This could be achieved by creating some metadata on app load.
            -For example, store the names of each char that exists in each table
            -This metadata can be accessed easily without performing additional queries and such

OOP OVERHAUL:
