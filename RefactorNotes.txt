-LEFT OFF:
    -Added a ton of jank and bloat classes to try and parse the yellow text shit
        -clean that shit up!
        

-BUGS:
    -Yellow Text Window not closing
    -Inventory Reader Broken
    -Refactor methods that interact with the GUI
        -Consider moving both GUI + methods into same class

-TODO:
    -Create a DELETE YELLOW TEXT for indiviudal char_names
    -Refactor which methods go into windows / methods classes
    -Refactor 'fill_table_with_array()' type methods to use global data rather than parameter?

    -Yellow Text:
        -Loop over char_names
        -Start from bottom. If row is already in DB, we dont have to go any further, and can move on to the next char
        -When match is found:
            -SELECT * from yellowText where charName = x AND enemy = y AND date = z
            -if len(res), BREAK and move to next char_name
            -else:
                -push line into 'batch_inserts'
            -after all chars_iterated over, batch_insert
